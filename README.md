# NNETAR

Using the helpful Forecast Package, I coupled various models to serve as exogenous regressors with the NNETAR function.  

Although I use an univariate time series, I build a covariate matrix using outlier data points.

NNETAR is a multi-layer feed-forward network.

I have found the NNETAR function to be incredibly helpful with problems with limited training data
